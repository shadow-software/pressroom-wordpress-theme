/**
 * WHY THIS PLUGIN EXISTS
 *
 * These 17 blocks used to live in the Broadside theme. The WordPress.org theme
 * scanner rejected that, and it was right to:
 *
 *     REQUIRED: The theme uses the register_block_type() function in the file
 *     inc/blocks.php. register_block_type() is plugin-territory functionality
 *     and must not be used in themes. Use a plugin instead.
 *
 * The Theme Directory's requirements list "Custom blocks" as plugin territory
 * outright, and the test behind that rule is a good one:
 *
 *     Themes handle presentation. Plugins handle content.
 *     ANYTHING A USER LOSES WHEN THEY SWITCH THEMES IS PLUGIN TERRITORY.
 *
 * Six of these blocks fail that test on the merits, not on a technicality. A
 * Short Answer, an FAQ, a Sources list — those are CONTENT. They live in
 * post_content. If they shipped with the theme, then switching themes would
 * silently blank a reader's FAQ, and the author would have no way to get it back.
 * Putting them in a plugin is not compliance theatre; it is the correct place for
 * them, and the rule exists to protect the user from exactly that.
 *
 * The other eleven — the nameplate, the folio rule, the byline — are pure
 * presentation, and there is a real argument they belong in the theme. The rule
 * does not make that exception, and a rule enforced by a scanner does not
 * negotiate. They come too, so that the whole newspaper lives in one place rather
 * than being split across an invisible seam.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE THEME
 *
 * Broadside's own templates reference these blocks — parts/masthead.html asks for
 * broadside/nameplate, templates/single.html asks for broadside/byline. Without
 * this plugin the theme still renders: WordPress simply omits a block it cannot
 * find. You get the paper, the type and the grid, but no nameplate and no folio.
 * The theme declares `Requires Plugins: broadside-blocks` in style.css, so
 * WordPress 6.5+ offers to install this alongside it.
 *
 * THE DEPENDENCY RUNS ONE WAY
 *
 * This plugin calls ten helpers that live in the THEME (shadow_digest_get(),
 * shadow_digest_nameplate(), shadow_digest_avatar(), …). Nothing in the theme
 * calls into this plugin. That direction is deliberate and it is load-bearing:
 * the theme is useful without the plugin, and every call the plugin makes into
 * the theme is guarded by function_exists(), so activating this plugin under a
 * DIFFERENT theme degrades to empty output instead of a fatal error.

/*
 * A NOTE ON shadow_digest_plain_text(), AND ON A FATAL I NEARLY SHIPPED.
 *
 * That helper lives in the THEME (inc/template-tags.php). Every block that calls
 * it does so from inside a render callback, and every render callback is already
 * behind broadside_blocks_theme_active() — so under another theme they return
 * before they can reach an undefined function. Safe.
 *
 * The exception is shadow_digest_print_faq_schema(), which runs on wp_footer and
 * therefore NOT through the render guard. The obvious fix — have the plugin define
 * its own copy behind `if ( ! function_exists() )` — is wrong, and wrong in a way
 * that is worth writing down, because it looks obviously right:
 *
 *     WordPress loads PLUGINS BEFORE THE THEME.
 *     wp-settings.php: plugins_loaded fires at line 622, the theme's
 *     functions.php is included at line 739.
 *
 * So function_exists() is ALWAYS false when a plugin asks. The plugin defines the
 * function, the theme then defines it again, and PHP fatals on the redeclare —
 * every page, HTTP 500, both live sites. I wrote exactly that, and the sandbox
 * returned 500 on the next request. That is what the sandbox is FOR.
 *
 * The right fix needs no second definition: the one unguarded caller checks for
 * the theme itself, exactly like every other caller does. One function, one file,
 * no duplicate to drift.
