# Stand up a throwaway local WordPress to test the Digest theme.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: on 2026-07-13 this theme was deployed straight to a live
# shared VPS without ever having been run anywhere. It contained an infinite
# recursion, which hung every PHP-FPM worker on the box and took down seven
# sites — including a live marketplace that had nothing to do with this theme.
# See docs/INCIDENT-2026-07-13-vps-outage.md.
#
# Nothing in this theme goes near a server again until it has rendered every
# template here first.
#
# The sandbox is deliberately hostile to the bug that caused that outage:
#
#   * max_execution_time = 10, enforced by the CLI SAPI (unlike FPM, the CLI
#     server DOES honour it), so a runaway request dies in ten seconds instead
#     of forever.
#   * memory_limit = 256M, so a recursion exhausts its own memory and fatals
#     with a readable stack trace rather than swallowing the machine's RAM.
#   * xdebug.max_nesting_level, if xdebug is present, turns infinite recursion
#     into an immediate, named error.
#
# A recursion here produces a stack trace in a second. The same recursion on the
# VPS produced a forty-minute outage. That is the whole argument for this file.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/local-wp.sh up        # build the site and start it on :8080
#   ./scripts/local-wp.sh down      # tear it all down
#   ./scripts/local-wp.sh reset     # down, then up
