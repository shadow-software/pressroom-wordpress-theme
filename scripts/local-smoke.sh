# This is the test that would have prevented the 2026-07-13 outage. Run it before
# any deploy. It is not thorough — it is a tripwire. It asks one question of every
# template: does this page render, quickly, without a fatal?
#
# The timing matters as much as the status code. The recursion that killed the
# production server returned no error at all; it simply never finished. A page
# that takes more than a couple of seconds here is guilty until proven innocent.
