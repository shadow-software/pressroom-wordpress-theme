# This exists for the same reason deploy.sh exists. The last time something left
# this repo for a live server it went by hand, and it took a production box down.
# A theme submission is lower stakes than a deploy, but it is the same failure
# shape: a human assembling an artifact by hand, from memory, and shipping it
# somewhere they cannot easily take it back from. A rejected submission costs a
# week of queue time, and the reviewer tells you one problem at a time.
#
# So the zip is built, then INSPECTED — the checks below are the ones the Theme
# Review team actually runs, applied to the exact bytes that would be uploaded,
# not to the working tree they were copied from.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/package.sh              build + verify → build/<slug>-<version>.zip
#   ./scripts/package.sh --check      verify only, build nothing (CI uses this)
