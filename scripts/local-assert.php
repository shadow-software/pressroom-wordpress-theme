/**
 * Correctness assertions for the local sandbox.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM local-smoke.sh:
 *
 * While validating the fix for the 2026-07-13 outage I deliberately reintroduced
 * the recursion bug to prove the re-entrancy guard worked. It did — the page
 * rendered in 116ms instead of hanging forever. But then the smoke test, which
 * only checks status codes and response times, reported "ALL TEMPLATES PASS —
 * safe to consider deploying" **while the bug was still in the file**.
 *
 * That is the whole lesson of the incident restated in miniature. A test that
 * only asks "did the page load?" will happily bless broken code. The guard turns
 * a server-killing hang into a quietly wrong page — which is a good trade, but it
 * means liveness checks alone can no longer detect the bug.
 *
 * So this file asserts what the page must actually CONTAIN. It is the test that
 * would have caught the original bug on its own, without a guard, without a
 * server, and without an outage.
 *
 * Run: php scripts/local-assert.php
