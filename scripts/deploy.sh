# Deploy the Digest theme to ONE site, safely.
#
# This script exists because the previous deploy procedure was `rsync`, run by
# hand, straight to two live sites, with a theme that had never been executed
# anywhere. It contained an infinite recursion and it took down a shared VPS —
# and with it a live firearms marketplace that had nothing to do with this theme.
# See docs/INCIDENT-2026-07-13-vps-outage.md.
#
# So this is not a convenience wrapper. It is a gate. It refuses to deploy unless:
#
#   1. The theme lints (PHP + JSON).
#   2. There is no live do_blocks() call in a render callback — the exact shape of
#      the bug that caused the outage.
#   3. The local sandbox is running.
#   4. local-smoke.sh passes    — every template renders, fast, no fatals.
#   5. local-assert.php passes  — the pages are CORRECT, not merely alive.
#      (Liveness alone is not enough: the re-entrancy guard makes the recursion
#      render fast-but-wrong instead of hanging, so a smoke test cannot see it.)
#
# It deploys to ONE site. Deploying to two sites at once is how one bad theme
# becomes two broken sites, and the incident is why that is no longer possible in
# a single command.
#
# After uploading it verifies the live site — including an article page, which is
# the page class that broke last time and which was never checked before.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh cannabisdigest.net
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh marksmansdigest.com
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh <site> --rollback     # revert that site to the stock theme
